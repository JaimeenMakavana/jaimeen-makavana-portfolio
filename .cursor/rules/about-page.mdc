Context: I want to create a "Scrollytelling" experience that visualizes my career journey: From Chemical Engineering → IT → Full Stack → AI Architect.

Tech Stack:

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animation: Framer Motion (framer-motion)

The Task: Act as a Creative Frontend Developer. Create a new component named CareerJourneyParallax. This component should implement a vertical scroll-based narrative where text and visual elements move at different speeds (parallax) to create depth.

Data Source (The Narrative): Use the following stages for the content sections:

The Origin: LD College of Engineering. Chemical Engineering background. The realization of being "disconnected."

The Pivot: Self-learning sprint. Joining Webapster (Jr React Dev). Building the foundation.

The Expansion: Joining Koffeekodes. Full Stack & Architecture. Understanding end-to-end systems.

The Future (Current): Joining Key.ai. Machine Learning, Prompt Engineering, Autonomous Agents.

Detailed Implementation Requirements:

Architecture & Performance (Critical):

Use useScroll and useTransform from framer-motion to map scroll progress to animation values (y-axis, opacity, scale).

DO NOT use native window.addEventListener('scroll'). Strictly use Framer Motion's optimized hooks to run animations off the main thread where possible.

Implement a "Sticky Section" layout: The text should scroll normally on one side (or overlay), while the background/visuals remain "sticky" or move slowly to create the parallax effect.

Visual Design:

Theme: Dark Mode (Deep Slate/Black background).

Typography: Modern, clean sans-serif. Large headers for the "Era" titles.

Visuals: Since I don't have images yet, use Abstract Geometric Shapes (using CSS/SVG) or Gradient Orbs that morph/change color for each stage of the career to represent the evolution (e.g., Rigid Square for Engineering → Fluid Blob for AI).

Responsiveness:

Desktop: Full 2-column parallax layout (Text Left, Visuals Right).

Mobile: Collapse to a standard vertical stack. Disable complex scroll-jacking on mobile to ensure native scroll performance.

Code Structure:

Create a separate data array constant CAREER_MILESTONES at the top of the file containing the text content to keep the JSX clean.

Ensure all components are typed strictly with TypeScript.

Output: Generate the full code for CareerJourneyParallax.tsx.
